The problem set consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces that are centred and occupy about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorise each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
